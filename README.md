# Signal-Processing-Labs
This repo includes my solution to the labs, assignments, and course projects for the following university courses: Signals &amp; Systems, Communication Engineering, and Digital Communication using MATLAB and Python.

Implemented modules: Discrete time signals manipulation, Discrete time systems (such as LTI systems), Double sideband large carrier amplitude modulation, uniform quantizer/de-quantizer, digital communication filters (such as matched filters), and signal space representation using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
